* All variants of Crafting Tables can be used as fuel, with the exception of Crimson, Warped, and Netherwood.
* Kiln can now process Sandstone and Red Sandstone into their smooth variants.

🐞Fixed:

=======================
## [4.3.0] - 2021-04-03

Important Information:
* Built on Forge 36.1.0 now.
* The version of this mod can no longer run on Minecraft 1.16.4 and earlier. Please update to 1.16.5.

🌟Added:
* Quark enhancement is here! While installed, the additional blocks are available for Netherwood: Leaf Carpets, Hedges, Ladders, Vertical Slabs, Vertical Planks, and Posts.
* Added two new advancements: The Forgotten Red Ore and Cover Me in Bones!

🔧Changed:
* Made each crafting table look different from vanilla (oak) crafting table.
* Updated Nether Brick Door textures.
* Updated Netherwood Trapdoor textures.

==[ MINECRAFT 1.16.4]==
=======================
## [4.2.3] - 2020-12-28

Feast your eyes on those coloured crafting tables! There is also a new utility minecart: Minecart with Crafting Table.

🌟Added:
+ Added Crafting Table for each vanilla wood type! Crafted with four corresponding planks.
+ Also added Minecart with Crafting Table. Craft on the go! I recommend playing with Quark since you can attach minecarts with chains.
+ Added French translations for Kiln, Crafting Table variants, Minecart with Crafting Table, additional Stews, Guardian Scales, and Glowing & Resistance potions.

🔧Changed:
* Netherwood Saplings can be used in composters now.
* Changed ruby tool recipes to use tags, thus allowing such recipes to be made with rubies from other mods.

=======================
## [4.2.2] - 2020-11-23

Now that is quite a big update full of new additions!

🌟Added:
+ New block: Kiln! This furnace upgrade allows you to smelt clay (ball & block), sand, cobblestone, stone, netherrack, coloured terracotta faster! You also can turn certain brick blocks into cracked variants. Note that not all the remaining smelting recipes use the kiln, this is to ensure the furnace isn't obsolete.
+ New potions: Potion of Resistance and Potion of Glowing!
+ New item: Guardian Scales! Use them to brew Potions of Resistance!
+ New item: Stews! Feast your eyes on seven different stews! Pork, Beef, Chicken, Mutton, Fish, Spider, and Nether Fungus!
+ You can now use Prismarine Crystals to create Potions of Glowing!

🔧Changed:
* Updated Bone & Wither Bone leggings texture to make it easier to distinguish from boots.
* Tweaked Netherwood Planks and Netherwood Crafting Table textures.
* Updated Netherwood Door block and item textures.
* Updated Netherwood Boat entity texture.
* Updated Cake Slice item texture.
* Breaking cakes now cause cake slices to be dropped equal to 7 minus the amount of bites.
* Updated Cake Slice recipe to yield 7 slices due to cakes having 7 bites.
* Decreased hunger refill from fried spiders from 7 to 6 to make spider stews a bit more useful.
* The Striders went on a strike, complaining about how they were made irrelevant with the boats. Today, their prayers have been answered as the boats have underwent some modifications. Nerfed the movement speed of Nether boats in lava so they now move slower than the Striders while not being too slow! Now the Striders have an obvious advantage over the boats. Those boats still have the same movement speed as vanilla boats in water.

💭Known Issues:
- The recipe book includes furnace. Unfortunately, it's not easy to fix as the recipe book enums are hardcoded.

=======================
## [4.2.1] - 2020-11-12

This update aims to bring consistency and also fixes some issues.

🌟Added:
+ Coded Netherwood Beehive. Currently not obtainable as it doesn't really work as bees wouldn't attempt to enter one. Perhaps I will find a way to get it working. Until then, it's not craftable nor is it in creative inventory.
+ New block: Netherwood Bookshelf! Craft in the same way you would normally craft bookshelves but with Netherwood planks. Works just like the vanilla bookshelves.
+ Added translations for the new blocks for French and German.

🔧Changed:
* Now built on Forge 35.0.7+.
* Moved pl_pl.json to its correct location. Note that it contains no translations yet, and it's empty.
* Tweaked some German texts for Netherwood-related objects.
* Piglins will now react to Netherwood Chests, and trapped variants, in same manner as vanilla chests.
* Hoes now break Netherwood Leaves faster.

🐞Fixed:
> Fixed Netherwood Apple Pie tooltip name in Canadian English.
> Fixed Netherwood sign text colour not changing when dye is applied. This elusive, pesky bug was around and I had difficulty in fixing it. Until now.

=======================
## [4.2.0] - 2020-11-04

Had to add the 0 to version number ;)
Anyways, this is the mod release for 1.16.4. It involves some tweaks to Netherwood trees.

🌟Added:
+ Coded Netherwood Forest biome. It's currently not generated but you can test that out in buffet world type. The biome is intended to have the largest density of Netherwood trees.

🔧Changed:
* Now built on Forge 35.0.1 and that's the minimum Forge version, for Minecraft 1.16.4.
* Nerfed the rate in which Netherwood Trees get generated at most Nether biomes.
* Changed the default frequency of Netherwood Trees in config from 16 to 12.
* Changed mod config file from morecraft-common.toml to morecraft.toml

❌Removed:
- Removed morecraft-client.toml as the config file is empty.

==[ MINECRAFT 1.16.3]==
=======================
## [4.2b3] - 2020-10-28

This is going to be the last of the beta release before the full 4.2.0 release, scheduled for 1.16.4!

In addition to the Glowstone Lanterns and Sweetberry Pies, it also features gear rebalancing to make sure Netherite isn't overshadowed and make some materials more distinct and viable.

🌟Added:
+ New block: Glowstone Lanterns! Works identically to regular lanterns and has maximum brightness.
+ New item: Sweetberry Pies! Restores 8 points of hunger when eaten and has 0.8 saturation.
+ Added French and German translations to Glowstone Lanterns and Sweetberry Pies.
+ Added Chainmail recipe. Use the Chains to craft a suit of chainmail. I know it's slightly expensive but hey, chainmail should be rarer, right?

🔧Changed:
* Bone Lord and Wither Bone now use Smithing Table. Upgrade Bone Armour with Skeleton Skull for Bone Lord armour, and Wither Bone for Wither Bone equipment. The old recipes are removed.
* Changed the Wither Bone recipe to yield only 1 Wither Bone. To compensate, each Wither Bone can be broken down into 6 Wither Bonemeals.
* Nerfed the Wither Bone so its durability now sits between Diamond and Netherite. Harvesting speed is also slightly nerfed but it's still slightly faster than Netherite. All in all, Wither Bone is now designed to be a sidegrade to Netherite.
* Enderdragon Scale armour now offers slightly less protection than diamond, but it still remains extremely durable and enchantable.
* Obsidian tool material now has its harvest speed adjusted to be on par with Golden tools. Obsidian material enchantability adjusted to be just 2 above gold.
* Adjusted Ruby enchantability to be just 2 below gold.
* Unified Emerald enchantability of both tools and armour to be both 16.
* Increased the Harvest Level of Wither Bone and Bedrock tools to 4 to match Netherite.
* Updated Enderdragon Scale chestplate and leggings item textures.
* Adjusted Bone and Wither Bone armour texture so leggings are now more noticeable, and the codpiece appears when wearing leggings instead of boots.
* Changed Bone Lord armour textures to make it closer to the default 16x16 resolution.
* Updated Bedrock Bricks texture to be based on the new Bedrock texture.
* Changed default Netherwood generation frequency back to 16.

🐞Fixed:
> Adjusted French and German translations of a few more items I've overlooked.
> Fixed Glowstone Torch and Name Tag recipe toast not appearing.
> Fixed Elytra crafting recipe and the toast should also now appear when having End Crystal and Phantom Membrane.
> Fixed Totem crafting recipe. It also should now be very expensive to make.

❌Removed:
- Removed recipe configuration from config file for now. I still don't know how to re-implement conditional recipes.

=======================
## [4.2b2] - 2020-10-24

In addition to Netherite Trapdoors being introduced, here's a boatload of fixes and tweaks!

🌟Added:
+ New block: Netherite Trapdoors. Like iron trapdoors, they can only be opened with Redstone signal. Craft with 4 Netherite ingots in same manner as you would normally craft using iron ingots. Like other Netherwood-related items, they can't burn in lava.
+ Added French and German translations for Warped & Crimson Boats and Netherite Doors & Trapdoors.

🔧Changed:
* Redone the translations of France French and Canadian French for consistency with the rest of vanilla items. I may have overlooked some things.
* Updated German translations to better match the rest of the items. Fixed accent characters of de_at.json.
* You now need diamond pickaxe or better to properly break and pick up Netherite Doors and Trapdoors. They'll take long to break and drop nothing otherwise.
* Netherite Horse Armour item is now immune to lava.
* Ruby blocks can now be used as base for Beacons and Rubies can now be used as payment for beacons.

🐞Fixed:
> Fixed the missing recipes and added recipe toasts: Netherwood Trapdoors and Stripped Netherwood Wood.
> Fixed the Knockback Resistance on certain armours.
> Fixed the transparency for potted Netherwood Saplings.
> Fixed the pickaxe harvest level requirements for mod-added blocks that require minimum harvest level.
> Fixed the items disappearing within Netherwood chests and their trapped variant.

=======================
## [4.2b1] - 2020-10-21

It has been quite the undertaking but MoreCraft is now on Forge for Minecraft 1.16.3! As such, this mod is in beta. There may be additional features down the line but it's a significant update.

Now built on Forge 34.1.23 and as such, this is the minimum version to use the mod.

🌟Added:
+ Added Warped and Crimson Boats. Seems weird that those wood types are missing the boats. They can float on lava. Don't worry, Striders are still there! They might be a bit sad.
+ Added Netherite Doors. They can only be opened with redstone signal just like iron doors. They're blast-proof. No trapdoors yet, though. Made with 6 Netherite Ingots.
+ Added Netherite Horse Armour. Obtain by upgrading Diamond Horse Armour at Smithing Table using one Netherite Ingot, just like how you'd upgrade diamond gear.

🔧Changed:
* Updated the code for generation of Ruby Ores and Netherwood Trees.
* Updated the textures of Netherwood Doors to look cleaner.
* Netherwood Trees now come in more forms. There's 30% chance the Netherwood Tree will be forked just like Acacia, this is done to diversify the looks.
* Netherwood Trees can now grow on Soul Soil.
* Added toast for Nether boats when looking at water. That may be changed at a point.
* Picking up leather now properly triggers recipe popup for saddles.

💭Known Issues:
- Lava still renders in nether boats. I don't know how I could fix that.
- Some odd inconsistency with some stuff.

==[ MINECRAFT 1.15.2]==
=======================
## [4.1.1] - 2020-11-23

This is the final mod update for Minecraft 1.15.2 and support will no longer be provided as the mod is now focused on newer versions of Minecraft. The content and fixes are backported from later versions.

🌟Added:
+ New blocks: Glowstone Lanterns and Netherwood Bookshelves! They maintain their functionality from later versions.
+ New potions: Potion of Resistance and Potion of Glowing!
+ New item: Guardian Scales! Use them to brew Potions of Resistance!
+ New item: Sweetberry Pies! Very sweet!
+ New item: Stews! Feast your eyes on six different stews! Pork, Beef, Chicken, Mutton, Fish, and Spider!

🔧Changed:
* Updated block and item textures to match mod version 4.2.2.
* Breaking cakes now cause cake slices to be dropped equal to 7 minus the amount of bites.
* Updated Cake Slice recipe to yield 7 slices due to cakes having 7 bites.
* Updated language files for parity.

🐞Fixed:
> Fixed Netherwood sign text colour not changing on applying dyes.

=======================
## [4.1.0] - 2020-07-04

Finally, the mod is now available on 1.15.2, so you can enjoy everything from Buzzy Bees and be able to play with this mod!

🔧Changed:
* Built on Forge 31.2.0 and as such, you need to run this version at minimum.
* There might still be some bugs as I had to change the code. AGAIN.

==[ MINECRAFT 1.14.4]==
=======================
## [4.0.2] - 2020-06-26

Just a small update to fix Glowstone Torch-related recipes and rebalance.
 
🐞Fixed:
> Fixed the recipe for Glowstone Torch to use Glowstone Dust, not block.
> Adjusted the Glowstone Torch recipe so it yields 2 torches instead of 4 for balance.
> Picking up Glowstone Dust should now trigger the Glowstone Torch recipe unlocked.

=======================
## [4.0.1] - 2020-06-09

🐞Fixed:
> Fixed JEI incompatibility issue.

=======================
## [4.0.0] - 2020-06-09

Hooray, the mod is now out of beta and into release! The mod also makes use of Biomes o' Plenty and NetherEx by having Netherwood trees generate in a few Nether biomes that fit the most.

If you're feeling quite primitive and savage, you can make carpet from flesh. And new type of bonemeal has been discovered, made from the bones of Withers. They seem to have substantially different effects! Lots of things have been fixed and polished, and consistency fixes have been brought to restore order.

🌟Added:
+ New block: Flesh Carpet. Crafted with two flesh blocks in similar manner to crafting carpets. Yields 6 carpets.
+ New item: Wither Bonemeal. If used on grass and podzol, it turns the blocks into mycelium. If used on flowers, it turns the flowers into Wither Rose. If used on saplings, it turns saplings into dead bushes. But hey, it makes dead bushes now renewable! You can obtain wither bonemeal by breaking down a Wither Bone by crafting. Each bone yields three bonemeals.
+ Added advancements for more recipes.
* Added translation for Health Boost-related items, Wither Bone Meal, and Flesh Carpet for all French and German variants.

🔧Changed:
* You can now properly break down cobwebs into 9 strings on a crafting grid.
* You can now craft Netherwood Wood from four Netherwood Logs, yielding three wood.
* Drowneds now have a chance to drop Zombie Heads, as they're variants of Zombies.
* Gunpowder Blocks are now flammable! Keep fire away from those blocks as fire will consume them quickly!
* Updated Netherwood Door and Flesh Block textures.
* Ruby Ores and Ruby Blocks now require iron pickaxe or better to harvest.
* Ender Blocks and Blaze Blocks now require stone pickaxe or better to pick up.
* Regular Apple Pies can be put in composter now.
* Changed de_at (Austrian German), de_ch (Swiss German), and de_de (German) so they're different.
* Cleaned up more code. The mod no longer uses logger to stop clogging up output.

🐞Fixed:
> Corrected the brewing process of Health Boost potions and should also no longer interfere with vanilla brewing.

=======================
## [4.0b2] - 2020-05-28

What is this? Another mod build? With lots of fixes and enhancements? Cats now got a bit more annoying and now they have taken a liking to Netherwood chests. In fact, they'd even try to sit on them! But hey, it's not all bad as you get to feast your eyes on this delicious change log! With so many changes, I'm closer to truly moving the mod out of Beta and into Release!

🌟Added:
+ New items: Health Boost Potions! Brew Enderdragon Scales into awkward potions to create them. They can be extended, strengthened and converted to splash and lingering potions as is the case with all vanilla potions.
+ Added more tags to more mod-added blocks. The list is non-exhaustive:
  * All four mod-added doors for doors
  * Netherwood trapdoor for trapdoors
  * Potted Netherwood Sapling for flower_pots
  * Ruby ores and blocks for Forge tags
  
🔧Changed:
* You'll now take lava damage while riding Netherwood Boats if your head is inside lava unless you have Fire Resistance. Avoid the lavafalls! Likewise, don't let your Netherwood Boat sink!
* Cats will now attempt to sit on Netherwood Chests.
* Nether Apple Pies also now grant random effects but the chance is increased and if rolled for random effects, there's 30% chance that effects will be amplified whenever applicable.
* Nether Apples (and the pie) can also confer Resistance, Fire Resistance, and Glowing in addition.
* For consistency, Blaze Hoes and Wither Bone Hoes now inflict fire and wither respectively.
* Obsidian Axe now strikes faster, on par with Diamond Axe in speed but still 1 higher damage than diamond.
* Bedrock Bricks are now immune to Enderdragon and Wither.
* Redone Gunpowder Block, Blaze Block, and Ruby Block textures.
* Redone Slime Armour, Flesh Armour, and Spider Silk Armour item texture to match the updated vanilla textures.
* Spider Silk worn armour texture has been changed.

🐞Fixed:
> Nether Apples now once again grant random effects when eaten.
> Wither Bone tools and armour are now Legendary-rarity once again.
> Wearing full Blaze armour should now grant Fire Resistance once again. It won't overwrite existing potion effect!

=======================
## [4.0b1] - 2020-05-18

More work has been done and many of the major bugs have been fixed. Thus I've decided to move the mod out of alpha and into beta. The main changes are that language files should be updated and it's now safe to get off Netherwood Boats while in lava.

🌟Added:
+ Added British English. Currently this is the same as Canadian English.
    
🔧Changed:
* Blaze armour item texture has been updated.
* Tweaked Emerald Axe texture to be a bit more shiny.

> You can now cook Rotten Flesh, Spiders, Squids, Guardian Meat, and Eggs with Smoker and Campfire.
> Ruby Ores now work with Blast Furnace.
> Wither tools now inflict Wither status effect and Blaze tools now set mobs on fire once again. Hoes are the current exception though.
> Fixed players catching fire after dismounting Netherwood Boats while in lava.

❌Removed:
- Removed recipe configuration from config file as I figure out how to get them working with recipes.

=======================
## [4.0a2] - 2020-05-15

This is the second alpha release and if things go well, the next release might be beta!

The prominent change is that the signs should be working on servers now!

🌟Added:
  * Added Netherwood Buttons and Netherwood Pressure Plates. Crafted in the same manner as other wooden buttons and pressure plates and behave the same way as vanilla wooden buttons and pressure plates.
  * You can now place Netherwood Saplings in Flower Pots!
  
🐞Fixed:
> Netherwood Signs should be working in servers now!
> Bone Lord armour is now marked as Uncommon-rarity.
> Ruby Ores now once again yield experience when mined.

=======================
## [4.0a1] - 2020-05-13

After over a week of struggling, I finally got the mod ported over to Minecraft 1.14.4 which means the massive hurdle has been crossed. There's still work to be done and as such, this mod is in alpha until I can get more bugs fixed. Make sure to use Forge 28.2.0+ or the mod won't work.

 
Change Log
🌟Added:
+ New additions!
  * Netherwood Trapdoor
  * Netherwood Sign (Currently disabled on multiplayer)
  * Netherwood Wood
  * Stripped Netherwood Logs & Wood
  * Four new horse armours!
    * Comes in bone, obsidian, ruby, and emerald.
    * All of them are craftable. To craft, it's the same shape as leather horse armour but replace the leather with the material except for the middle leather.
  * Netherwood Apple Pie
    * Craft as you would normally make Apple Pies, but with Nether Apple in place of regular apple.
    * Currently, there are no effects on eating other than refilling hunger.
  * With Minecraft having received new textures, many of the blocks and items now have textures changed for consistency. The old textures have been kept if you want to use Programmer Art textures.
    * Redone Ruby, Emerald, Obsidian, and Ender sword and armour item textures.
    * Redone Apple Pie and Nether Apple item textures to match closely to Pumpkin Pie.
    * Netherwood planks and chests have been redone.
    * Soul Glass texture has been tweaked so the border matches the new glass.
    * Updated Glass Door texture to match the new glass blocks, now much more clear.

  * Netherwood Logs and Netherwood Wood can be stripped with axe for consistency with the new log-stripping feature.
  * Leashes can be attached to Netherwood Fences.
  * Quality of Life: You can add poisonous potatoes to composter. Now they're no longer entirely useless!
  * As part of the integration, Netherwood Leaves, Nether Apples and Nether Apple Pies are compostable.
  * Changed the crafting recipe of iron, gold, and diamond horse armour to be consistent with leather horse armour.
  * Cobwebs now require 9 strings to make. This is not finalized.

💭Known Issues
- Netherwood Signs are currently disabled on multiplayer. It required having custom GUI to even get it working.
- Going into lavafall while in Netherwood Boat will sink your boat. Avoid them.
- Dismounting Netherwood Boat that is in lava will set you on fire.
- Ruby Ores don't yield XP while mined.
- Lava appears in Netherwood boats.
- Nether Apples no longer confer random effects.

What's Next?
* I will get around to cleaning up the code.
* Make sure the mod is fully working in the server.
* Find a way to re-add additional mob heads. They're coded but currently bugged and messes up inventory rendering while worn.

==[ MINECRAFT 1.12.2]==
=======================
## [3.2.0] - 2020-05-02

NOTE: The mod is no longer officially supported on 1.12.2 as it's an old Minecraft version. I recommend moving to the newer version.
Decided to move the mod out of beta and into release to have the mod be properly recognized for 1.12.2. I should have fixed many bugs.

🔧Changed:
* Increased maximum frequency of Netherwood trees in configuration from 32 to 50. The default remains 16.
* Changed the code of mob drops events to utilize getDrops() and cleaned up redundant condition checks.
* Decoupled TNT drop from creeper head drops meaning TNT can now rarely drop from creepers even if mob head drops are off. If creeper head drop would have been rolled when head drops are off, TNT will be dropped instead.
* Enderdragon Head should now be a guaranteed drop for first time kill, provided mob head drops are enabled.
* Elder Guardians will now drop Guardian Meat.
* Tinkered with Slime Armour code.

🐞Fixed:
> If Guardians die while they're on fire, they will drop cooked meat for consistency.
> Fixed an issue where Enderdragon scale helmet was facing south regardless of direction and the arms moving on armour stand. It involves a workaround. (I'm aware of Z-fighting)
> Re-added MoreCraft mod info.

=======================
## [3.2b3] - 2020-03-27

I've pretty much given up on fixing any bugs, especially the recipe issues. So for now, I've decided that I'll no longer support 1.12.2 and move forward to 1.14.4.

🔧Changed:
* Now requires Forge 14.23.5.2768+ for Minecraft 1.12.2.

🐞Fixed:
* Fixed inventory icon issues with doors in that appeared as fine in earlier builds but not in later builds of Forge.

=======================
## [3.2b2] - 2018-08-28

🐞Fixed:
> Fix a crash if used with Tinkers Construct. Tested and should work.

=======================
## [3.2b1] - 2018-09-13

It's been a long way but the mod is finally for 1.12.2! This is in beta stage so there might be bugs.

The version also retains the additional languages and armour value fixes for 1.12.2.

A lot has changed inside the mod functionality but otherwise should be mostly the same from 1.11.2 content-wise but with the integration of new advancements system. Except for a new issue below.

💭Known Issues:
- Crafting Netherwood chests and crafting tables are wonky, they'll show as vanilla in recipe. This is due to JSON recipes being wonky, and the mod recipes don't take priority over vanilla.
- Salvage recipes are not re-implemented due to the changes in JSON. This may or may not be re-instated.

==[ MINECRAFT 1.11.2]==
=======================
## [3.1.1] - 2018-08-20

Been a long time but here's a small update, primarily maintenance but adds language translations.

🌟Added:
+ Language translation! There are currently five languages.

  * French
  * Spanish
  * German
  * Russian

🔧Changed:
* Updated to be built on Forge 13.20.1.2386!
* Had to adjust a few code for the config GUI to work due to the slight change.

🐞Fixed:

=======================
## [3.1.0] - 2017-06-19

This is the first release of the mod for Minecraft 1.11.2! Huzzah!

🌟Added:
+ Added Trapped Netherwood Chests! They're created in the same way you would create regular trapped chests.
+ You can now craft Elytra and Totem of Undying. They're not cheap as well. Especially Totem of Undying, it's very expensive. The recipe is for you to figure out but here's a hint for elytra: emerald, strings, leather, papers, and feathers. The totem of undying involves emeralds, diamonds, gold ingots, enchanted golden apple, and nether star. Hardcore recipe will make them more expensive to make.

🔧Changed:
* Improved Quark compatibility. Certain aspects of this mod will be disabled to allow the stair and slabs from Quark to take precedence.
* Netherwood doors can now be dismantled for 2 wood planks.
* Adjusted the Netherwood door item for some consistency.
* Slightly tweaked the single Netherwood chest texture to have latch slot.

  * Blaze blocks now set mobs on fire once again.
  * Stone stairs recipes changed to only accept regular stones.

=======================
## [3.0.1] - 2017-05-14

🔧Changed:

* Soul glass and its pane variant now use ore dictionary.
* Soul glass can now be used in place of regular glass for vanilla recipes.

🐞Fixed:
> Corrected ruby display name.
> Brought the fixes from 2.9.1 maintenance update.

=======================
## [3.0.0] - 2017-05-13

Despite the version change, there isn't a lot of new features. I know it sucks but at least now the mod is available for Minecraft 1.10.2! Huzzah! Updating from 1.9.4 to 1.10.2 is a breeze actually.

🐞Fixed:
> Finally silenced the model loader error on console output by adding some dummy files. It's such a kludge but at least it works.

❌Removed:
- Removed Block of Bones. They're now in Minecraft 1.10.

=======================
## [2.9.1] - 2017-05-14

🐞Fixed:
> Fixed Enderdragon scale armour not rendering on mobs and armour stand.
> Fixed certain axes not having coloured rarity.
> MoreCraft logo now appears properly in mod options.

=======================
## [2.9.0] - 2017-05-13

At last, the mod is finally ported over to Minecraft 1.9.4! Now you can enjoy the newer features. Make sure to use Forge 12.17.0.1976+!

🌟Added:
+ Nether Apples. Has a chance to confer random effects, can be good or bad. This replaces the regular apple drops in netherwood trees.
+ Netherwood boats! In addition to standard capability of taking you across water, it can also take you across lava!
+ Enderdragon Scales. They replace the armour drops from Ender Dragon. Normally yields 4-7 scales but each level of Looting increases the maximum by 2. The amount is doubled for first kill.
+ Reinstated the enchanted Golden Apple recipe since it was removed from vanilla Minecraft, making it renewable again. Only if Hardcore Recipes are not enabled. 1.9 integration.

🔧Changed:
* Some of the higher-end armour now have Armour Toughness, part of 1.9 integration.
* MoreCraft-added Axes now have higher damage but slower, for consistency with the vanilla axes, part of 1.9 integration.
* Ender Dragon now has 20% chance to drop head. The chance is increased by 5% per level of Looting. This also makes Enderdragon head effectively renewable. Can be disabled by turning off mobHeadDrops.
* Endermen now have a chance to drop diamonds as rare drops. The chance is cut by 1/5 of usual for the End to account for how common Endermen are. Diamonds are now renewable.
* Squids and spiders now drop cooked variant if they die while on fire.
* Guardian meat, raw or cooked, can be fed to wolves.
* Changed the sound of equipping Enderdragon Scale armour to match that of leather.
* Enderdragon scale armour no longer has infinite durability but it still lasts hella long time. This is because Ender Dragon can be respawned.
* Mob spawner now appears under Miscellanous and Dragon Egg under Decoration Blocks in creative inventory. Vanilla-enhancing!

🐞Fixed:
> Managed to fix a duplicate default text on tooltip text in config.
> Picking up Netherwood Logs now award Getting Wood achievement.
> Crafting Netherwood Crafting Table now award Benchmarking achievement.

❌Removed:
- Removed Ender Bricks since End Bricks are now in vanilla Minecraft. The stairs and slabs now use the vanilla textures and renamed to match. Part of 1.9 integration.
- Removed endermanBlockDrops since it's no longer needed. Endermen drop blocks in vanilla Minecraft now.
